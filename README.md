ADACS coding workshop
20 - 22 March 2023

Day 1: 20 March 2023
1. create 'sky_sim.py' following the example on the instruction page.
This script produces random objects surrounding the coordinate of M31 within +/- 1 deg together with the IDs.
The resulting .csv file is named 'catalog.csv'

2. Edit the codes and score using pylint (pip install).
The initial requirement is to install github on the local machine.
During the process, github would be used to track the versions.

3. Link the file 'mymodule' to github.
First of all, create a new repository called 'symmetrical-octo-parakeet' from github.com.
Then go to 'mymodule' directory and link the local file to the repository.
Github would require a public key to link the repository to the local machine.
After achieving, any updates on the codes and in the file would be easily uploaded.


Day 2: 21 March 2023
1. Documentation on the codes
Provide more information on the written codes using comments in each def function().
